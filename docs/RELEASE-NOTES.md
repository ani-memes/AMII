### Added

- `Discreet Mode`, when enabled MIKU will clear and not show _any_ anime in the IDE. Also, the mood in the status bar
  will temporarily hide as well.
- Added 2021.3 Build support. Plugin only supports 2020.3+ builds now.

### Fixed

- The settings UI overflow issues, that prevented all content from being seen. (I can scrollbar better)
- Minor issue with plugin attempting to dismiss active memes. ([#123](https://github.com/ani-memes/AMII/issues/123))
